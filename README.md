### About 

This app is a memory game build with React. This project was fun yet challenging, break up UI componets, manage componet state, and respond to user events.

The objective of the game is to click every picture atleast once to win but every time you click a picture it shuffles the picuture array so you have to use some memory. If you click every picuture only once you win!!
