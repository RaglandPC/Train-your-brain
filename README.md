### About 
This app is a memory game build with React. This project was fun yet challenging, break up UI components, manage component state, and respond to user events.


The objective of the game is to click every picture at least once to win but every time you click a picture it shuffles the picture array so you have to use some memory. If you click every picture only once you win!!
